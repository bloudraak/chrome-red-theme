# Chrome Theme: Red

## Why

I often run different versions of Chrome and needed a theme to visually differenciate one version from another.  Most other themes were too busy for my liking. 

So the goal here was to create a theme that

* has **no noise**, so there’s no
* has **no distractions**, so there is no images of unicorns, fluffy cats or the brats of my nephew. 
* is **visually discernible** so at a glance I have context as to which version of Chrome I’m working with.

For some, my choice of color or the lack of pictures may be distracting, even worse, disturbing. Colors and minimalizm means different things in different cultures.

## Contributions

If you think my shade of red is a tad off, I’d love to see what you had in mind. Fork this repository, make a change, and if you’d like, submit a pull request.  We may debate which shade of red is the right red and experiment to see how well it works.
