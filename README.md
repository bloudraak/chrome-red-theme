# Red Chrome Theme

I needed something visually to differenciate one instance of chrome from another. The current themes are simply to "busy" for everyday use. So my goal was to develop a theme with less noise, less distractions but visually discernible. This allows you to run the release version of chrome, Chrome Canary and Chromium.
